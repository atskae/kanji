1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,750
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
You listened to "Cherry Blossom", "Wind", and "The Flower that only Grows Here".

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,750
I have, um, a hometown called Miyazaki.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Even now, um,

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,750
I gather with my related uncles and aunts.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,750
Or, as it is called,

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,000
like a hometown gathering,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,200
we remove the sliding door of our house and there is a place where we have everyone gather together.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,250
And over there,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,750
when I go there every year,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,750
I think of things like "I changed a little",

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,500
or like "I'm thinking of such excessive things".

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,500
I realized that, whenever I'm there, I can capture all of these thoughts.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,750
We only have normal conversations,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,750
and every year, we have the same food,

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,750
no matter how many years later, it's the same.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,250
Roll sushi, and

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,500
the same sashimi, and

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
the same chicken dishes appear.

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,750
Nothing changes, but,

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,500
Because of that, I am able to notice that I've changed.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,500
It's like,

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,500
it's very...

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
I thought of it like that, and thought "oh, right."

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,000
If you go far from your hometown that much,

27
00:01:16,100--> 00:01:18,250
you cover yourself with the part of you that isn't you,

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,750
and that part ends up walking ahead.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
And there are times where you feel like you want to surpass that part.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,500
"So there are times like that", I thought.

31
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,900
So to me, the part of my hometown that I imagined,

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,750
the song called "The Flower that only Grows Here",

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,750
is very big.

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,500
But whenever I talk about my hometown story to Kuroda,

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,250
like about removing the sliding door and relatives gathering, or

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
when I was little, I would stay over the whole time,

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
the same kid that was 5 years, 10 years old,

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,500
even when that kid became an adult, the fact that we are together even now,

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,950
is unbelieveable in a way. From the time he partnered with me,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I continuously told him this,

41
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,000
it was those gatherings, I would say, but

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,750
he didn't have much of a thing like a family gathering.

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,750
For a long time, he's been saying this.

44
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,550
And so,

45
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,250
I wonder,

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
in a town called Osaka,

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
where Kuroda was born, then left Sakai,

48
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,750
then traveled around the country.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To be at such a large Kyosera Dome,

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,000
as if,

51
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,000
we removed the sliding door,

52
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,750
gathered together,

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,500
in other words,

54
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,100
this is the hometown, right?

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,250
of Kobukuro fans.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,750
That's right.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,750
I think that.

58
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
There's no other people who would gather like this.

59
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,250
I have my own, actual hometown, but,

60
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
To me, and to Kuroda,

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,200
you all work hard to gather like this for us,

62
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,250
this place,

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,750
is Kobukuro's hometown.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,250
There is no doubt about that.

65
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you.

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,500
"The Osaka Dome is my hometown" is, you're a bit...

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
cool, wow.

68
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,150
That was a metaphor.

69
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,700
The Osaka Dome is my hometown.

70
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,600
No, not actually.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
You weren't actually born here.

72
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,500
Well, yeah.

73
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,000
I didn't mean it like that.

74
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,000
This is usually the normal ground.

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
So here, you,

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,100
eat roll sushi and, 

77
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,500
every time, it's the same?

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Every time it's roll sushi and sashimi, and

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,250
that's all that ever appears?

80
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,500
That's right.

82
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,250
That's all there is?

83
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,750
Yes.

84
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,000
If you spread out all that food here,

85
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,800
I think you'll definitely get in trouble.

86
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,500
A metaphor.

87
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,500
By the way,

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,750
like just now, like "woah",

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
with the flow of "The Flower that only Grows Here" I think... but,

90
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
it's like I am,

91
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
um, what?

92
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,000
Can you stop saying it like my family relationships are weak?

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's not true.

94
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Like that,

95
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,250
like that *adjective*,

96
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,500
or saying it like *adjective*, can you stop saying it like that?

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
But, whenever you go to the street with me,

98
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
like that time we went somewhere in Wakayama,

99
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,750
for a long time, from your mom or something,

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the phone was ringing for a long time,

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,500
"Ugh."

102
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,450
"Ugh", you were carelessly responding like that on the street.

103
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,250
Kuroda, what happened?

104
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,500
Like I'm getting a call from home.

105
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,000
Hello?

106
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,900
Mmhm.

107
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,800
Like I said, I'm not going.

108
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Not going.

109
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,900
I'm not going.

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What, what are you saying you're not going to?

111
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,900
A relative's wedding.

112
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,000
Go!

113
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,650
Go.

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hey, hey.

115
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,000
To relatives who adored you since you were this small.

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,500
Hey, hey!

117
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,000
It's that person who became quite a problem!

118
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Stop it.

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then after he completely hung up the phone, I convinced him, and

120
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
in the end, he went.

121
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,000
Stop it.

122
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just go from the start!

123
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't make me convince you to go. Just go, you.

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,100
You have this side of you.

125
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,500
Hey you, you...

126
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
that's my personal information!

127
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't say that in front of 50,000 people!

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Well...

129
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,000
You should at least value those little things.

130
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,100
In the street, when you said you were hungry,

131
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,000
you said, "Kobuchi, should we go home?"

132
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,000
and I said, "I'm not particularly hungry."

133
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
"I'm going to eat at home so I'll call home."

134
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,900
So he called and said,

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,500
Hello?

136
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,500
Mom? Huh.

137
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,400
What's for dinner?

138
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,900
From the other end I heard, with a small voice,

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,750
"Napolitan"

140
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,500
is what I heard.

141
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:51,500
Idiot!

142
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Then he hung up the phone.

143
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,000
Isn't he horrible???

144
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,750
That's not true, everyone.

145
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
He asks about dinner,

146
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Hey, please listen to me.

147
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,500
but depending on the response, he says "Idiot!"

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Everyone.

149
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,500
My mom, um,

150
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's a thing called balancing supply and demand, right?

151
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,750
How to say...

152
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,750
Even if you spend time making something,

153
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
even if hypothetically speaking,

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,100
who in the family,

155
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,000
not one person in the family says this thing tastes good,

156
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,000
she is the type of mom with this strong mental preserverence to keep serving that thing.

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Does this happen to you?

158
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
And so,

159
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,250
to a degree so astonishing,

160
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,150
every time she makes chicken stew at home,

161
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,400
it smells so bad.

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,350
Now everyone,

163
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
It's not just me!

164
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,000
Everyone in the Kuroda family,

165
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,500
"Ugh, what?"

166
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,000
"That smells so bad!"

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Stop that!

168
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,900
Who's going to eat that?

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No one's going to eat that.

170
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,900
"What are you saying?"

171
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
"The other day, when I brought it over to Takenaka", he said

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
"Kuroda's chicken stew is"

173
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
"sooo good~"

174
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But everyone says otherwise!

175
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,000
It's only you two.

176
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,700
Immediately when something happens,

177
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Takenaka is brought up.

178
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,250
Even though no one in the Kuroda family says this.

179
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,500
Well isn't it that?

180
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,900
You want to make food that you've eaten elsewhere at home.

181
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,000
My mom was also the same.

182
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,000
At a restaurant, when she thought "wow, this tastes so good."

183
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,800
she would make pretty much make the exact same dish at home.

184
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
She was very skilled at cooking, so

185
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,600
we had moments like, "hey, it's that dish we ate at that restaurant."

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But Kuroda's mom is,

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,750
On certain days when you come home, that happens right?

188
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
While dressed like Itamae,

189
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,750
make sushi...

190
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
No, no, no.

191
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,000
Kobuchi, that is wrong.

192
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,000
That is wrong.

193
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,250
Wait, everyone.

194
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,000
At home, sushi,

195
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hey, you!

196
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:22,500
At home,

197
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,000
On the DVD recording day,

198
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
don't make fun of the Kuroda family!

199
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,000
No, actually,

200
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,250
what you can do at home, you see,

201
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,500
um, is up to hand-rolled sushi level.

202
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,750
Wait, wait, wait wait.

203
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Wait.

204
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,900
That is incorrect.

205
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
That is your mother's kindness.

206
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Ah, is that so?

207
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,500
A day before, yeah?

208
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,900
The Kuroda family were together,

209
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,000
when we were watching TV,

210
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,900
a thing so amazing, like,

211
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
delicious-looking sushi restaurant was on TV.

212
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
"I sure want to eat sushi like that."

213
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,000
We were all saying that.

214
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,000
The next day, my mom said,

215
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,000
"Today's dinner,"

216
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
"is sushi I made."

217
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,000
Does that type of mom exist?

218
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,000
Me and everyone,

219
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,000
"We didn't mean that."

220
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,500
No!

221
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We want to go and eat there!

222
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
See? She becomes a sushi chef.

223
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,500
It's nerve-wracking,

224
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,500
after that.

225
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
From then on, it's

226
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,000
hell.

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sushi-rice

228
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,250
"Hey, you all,"

229
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,500
"if you're rolling sushi bit by bit"

230
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
"then you have to roll it least 100 times"

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
On top of a giant riceball,

232
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
tuna, bam!

233
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,900
On a riceball made of sushi rice,

234
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,000
is a tiny amount of tuna.

235
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,000
The balance is, off.

236
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
When I'd say, "Isn't the rice kinda big?"

237
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,000
"Well, with that"

238
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,000
"no matter how much tuna you have, it won't be enough."

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,500
With that,

240
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
just eat it with a lot of soy sauce.

241
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,250
Ew.

242
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,900
How do I eat this?

243
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,000
That's why I want to eat at a restaurant...

244
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,000
That's why...

245
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's why I don't like,

246
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,250
eating at home...

247
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,900
When I came home on Saturday,

248
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,250
"All right,"

249
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,000
"it's lunch time."

250
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,400
"Napolitan."

251
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,500
and as it appears.

252
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
as I tried it, something was, a little off...

253
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Wait.

254
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,000
Is this,

255
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Napolitan?

256
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,100
When I asked,

257
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,250
Hm?

258
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,500
Did you realize?

259
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,000
Today, um, um,

260
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,000
I didn't have spaghetti,

261
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
so I used fried noodles.

262
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,900
Hey. Hey!

263
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,350
Genius.

264
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,250
Isn't she a genius?

265
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
This is ketchup fried noodles!

266
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,000
Then make fried noodles!

267
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,800
Why?!

268
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why do you make it based on Napolitan?!

269
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If all we have is fried noodles,

270
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
then it's nearly the same.

271
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,750
Why with ketchup?

272
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,000
Why does the goal start with Napolitan?

273
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,750
No.

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
You make it with things you have.

275
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,500
Napolitan, from there fried noodles...

276
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Isn't that strange?

277
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,500
That's wrong.

278
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You sure are stubborn, huh?

279
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,500
To your mom.

280
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You,

281
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,500
you don't know.

282
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,000
*Something* will come from my mom,

283
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,500
when she watches this DVD.

284
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
I have no idea, seriously.
