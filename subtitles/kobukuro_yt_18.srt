1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,750
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
We had you listen to "Sakura", "Wind", and "The Flower that Only Grows Here".

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,750
I have, um, a hometown called Miyazaki.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Even now, um,

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,750
I gather with my related uncles and aunts.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,750
Or, as it is called,

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,000
like a hometown gathering,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,200
we remove the sliding door of our house and there is a place where we have everyone gather together.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,250
And over there,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,750
when I go there every year,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,750
I think of things like "I changed a little",

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,500
or like "I'm thinking of such excessive things".

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,500
I realized that, whenever I'm there, I can capture all of these thoughts.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,750
We only have normal conversations,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,750
and every year, we have the same food,

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,750
no matter how many years later, it's the same.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,250
Roll sushi, and

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,500
the same sashimi, and

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
the same chicken dishes appear.

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,750
Nothing changes, but,

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,500
Because of that, I can notice that I've changed.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,500
It's like,

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,500
it's very...

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
I thought of it like that, and thought "oh, right."

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,000
If you go far from your hometown that much,

26
00:01:16,000--> 00:01:18,250
you cover yourself with the part of you that isn't you,

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,750
and that part ends up walking ahead.

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
And there are times where you feel like you want to surpass that part.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,700
"So there are times like that", I thought.

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,100
So to me, the part of my hometown that I imagined,

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,750
the song called "The Flower that Only Grows Here",

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,750
is very big.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
But whenever I talk about my hometown story to Kuroda,

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,250
like about removing the sliding door and relatives gathering, or

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
when I was little, I would stay over the whole time,

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
the same kid that was 5 years, 10 years old,

37
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,500
even when the kid becomes an adult, the fact that we are together even now,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,950
is unbelieveable in a way. From the time he partnered with me,

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I continuously told him this,

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,000
it was those gatherings, I would say, but

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,750
he didn't have much of a thing like a family gathering.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,750
For a long time, he's been saying this.

43
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,550
And so,

44
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,250
I wonder,

45
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
in a town called Osaka,

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
where Kuroda was born, then left Sakai,
