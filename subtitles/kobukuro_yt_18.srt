1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,750
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
You listened to "Sakura", "Wind", and "The Flower that Only Grows Here".

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,750
I have, um, a hometown called Miyazaki.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Even now, um,

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,750
I gather with my related uncles and aunts.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,750
Or, as it is called,

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,000
like a hometown gathering,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,200
we remove the sliding door of our house and there is a place where we have everyone gather together.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,250
And over there,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,750
when I go there every year,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,750
I think of things like "I changed a little",

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,500
or like "I'm thinking of such excessive things".

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,500
I realized that, whenever I'm there, I can capture all of these thoughts.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,750
We only have normal conversations,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,750
and every year, we have the same food,

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,750
no matter how many years later, it's the same.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,250
Roll sushi, and

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,500
the same sashimi, and

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
the same chicken dishes appear.

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,750
Nothing changes, but,

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,500
Because of that, I can notice that I've changed.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,500
It's like,

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,500
it's very...

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
I thought of it like that, and thought "oh, right."

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,000
If you go far from your hometown that much,

27
00:01:16,000--> 00:01:18,250
you cover yourself with the part of you that isn't you,

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,750
and that part ends up walking ahead.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
And there are times where you feel like you want to surpass that part.

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,700
"So there are times like that", I thought.

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,100
So to me, the part of my hometown that I imagined,

32
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,750
the song called "The Flower that Only Grows Here",

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,750
is very big.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
But whenever I talk about my hometown story to Kuroda,

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,250
like about removing the sliding door and relatives gathering, or

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
when I was little, I would stay over the whole time,

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
the same kid that was 5 years, 10 years old,

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,500
even when that kid becomes an adult, the fact that we are together even now,

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,950
is unbelieveable in a way. From the time he partnered with me,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I continuously told him this,

41
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,000
it was those gatherings, I would say, but

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,750
he didn't have much of a thing like a family gathering.

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,750
For a long time, he's been saying this.

44
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,550
And so,

45
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,250
I wonder,

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
in a town called Osaka,

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
where Kuroda was born, then left Sakai,

48
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,750
then traveled around the country.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To be at such a large Kyosera Dome,

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,000
as if,

51
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,000
we removed the sliding door,

52
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,750
gathered together,

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,500
in other words,

54
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,100
this is the hometown, right?

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,250
of Kobukuro fans.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,750
That's right.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,750
I think that.

58
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
There's no other people who would gather like this.

59
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,250
To me I have my actual hometown, but,

60
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
To me, and to Kuroda,

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,200
you all work hard to gather like this for us,

62
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,250
this place,

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,750
is Kobukuro's hometown.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,250
There is no doubt about that.

65
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you.
