# Subtitles
Apparently you can add subtitles to YouTube videos: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698#zippy=%2Csubrip-srt-example%2Csubviewer-sbv-example%2Cbasic-file-formats

YouTube discontinued community translations unfortunately 😞

## Files
* [`kobukuro_yt_18.srt`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaOGt-NvBjk)
    * この会話 ich liebe 🤣
    * I manually wrote this one and repeatedly uploaded it through the Substital Chrome Extension on each edit (stupid me).
