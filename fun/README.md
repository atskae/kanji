Keeping track of amusing realizations I encountered when translating.

* 泥棒 - どろぼう - robber = "dirt stick"
* 気を付ける - きをつける - be careful = "stick the feeling (onto yourself)"
* 靴下 - くつした - socks = "shoes bottom"
* 落ち着く - 落ち着く - to calm down = "falling down arrives"
* 梅雨 - つゆ - rainy season = "plum rain"
