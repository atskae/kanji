# Subtitles
Apparently you can [add subtitles to YouTube videos[(https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698#zippy=%2Csubrip-srt-example%2Csubviewer-sbv-example%2Cbasic-file-formats) with `.srt` files.

[YouTube discontinued community translations unfortunately ](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en) 😞

## Files
* [`kobukuro_yt_18.srt`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaOGt-NvBjk)
    * この会話 ich liebe 🤣
    * I manually wrote this one and repeatedly uploaded it through the [Substital Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en) on each edit (stupid me).
