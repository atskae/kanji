1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,220
はい。

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,180
今日は

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,270
コブクロのカバンの中身

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,420
なんかだんだん

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,510
このYouTubeも慣れてきたね。

6
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,140
そうですね。

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,240
慣れてきたね？

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,540
ね？

9
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,190
楽しくなってきたね。

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,820
僕もこれから職業欄には

11
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,450
もう入れてる、入れ、

12
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,320
それ言うと

13
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,420
ほんまにWikipediaに書かれんねんから。

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,940
YouTuberで。

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,500
俺はもうYouTuberやで。

16
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,050
まあ、やってる時点で。

17
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,460
そうすね。

18
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,700
今日はえと

19
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,220
カバンの中身って言うやつ

20
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
これはよくね、テレビとかでやりますよね。

21
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,850
Right?

22
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Who would have thought that the day we'd do such a thing would come?

23
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,640
Honestly though,

24
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,120
we did have this conversation about

25
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,770
please do "Inside the Bag"

26
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,820
a TV show offered us to do.

27
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,120
(?) Since we didn't have spare time, we said no.

28
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,800
Until now we said "no" about 100 times.

29
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,870
(?) Why because of spare time?

30
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,820
This story, this story. right?

31
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,240
People that think of YouTube, you know

32
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,510
when they asked us "How about next time?"

33
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,230
The time we said "ok"

34
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,180
the staff was so surprised.

35
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,100
Even though before we refused that much.

36
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,410
Right.

37
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,170
Kuroda's bar for YouTube,

38
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,220
is very low.

39
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,650
That's how serious I am about YouTube.

40
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,230
This is ok.

41
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,520
Ok, then

42
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,240
Kobuchi

43
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,130
Is it ok to show something realistic?

44
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,390
This is the bag I always carry.

45
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:02,960
Kobuchi bag.

46
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,000
Hey, Kuroda,

47
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,910
can you quickly carry this with one hand?

48
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,300
With one hand.

49
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:06,730
With one hand.

50
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,350
Hold it quickly.

51
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,080
Hold it quickly.

52
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,390
Hey, my back is going to get messed up.

53
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,630
Well, I use this everyday.

54
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,780
Kobuchi is actually

55
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,200
as is, right?

56
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,440
There's a lot of stuff.

57
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,940
Ok, this is obvious.

58
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,870
My computer.

59
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Lyrics, memos, everything, songs.

60
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
We can't show the desktop computer, but

61
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,970
to the point where you don't know which one is which,

62
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,380
there's like 100 icons on there.

63
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,680
Right, there's an enormous amount.

64
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,390
It is messy.

65
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,550
Ah, well

66
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,430
Computer charger.

67
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,780
Charge.

68
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,480
This is,

69
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,840
You have this.

70
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,230
Yes, yes.

71
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,620
Well recently,

72
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,780
I have bought a camera.

73
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,580
What kind of camera did you buy?

74
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,000
This is amazing.

75
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,100
Um,

76
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,780
Even in this compact digital camera,

77
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,110
this Canon, G5X

78
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,150
So Kobuchi's, you see

79
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,550
that

80
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,250
Kobuchi's

81
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,710
This even comes with a tripod.

82
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,680
That's amazing.

83
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,360
It doesn't come with it.

84
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,980
I added it.

85
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,470
Oh you added it.

86
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:57,870
That's amazing.

87
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,860
(?) I devised this.

88
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,910
No matter what, you,

89
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,670
after a month, you'll stop using this thing.

90
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
You sure are annoying.

91
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,990
Anyways

92
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,310
Masks, right?

93
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,280
A mask case?

94
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,660
Yup.

95
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,280
I always put a mask case in here.

96
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:09,788
That and also

97
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,550
It's obvious, but

98
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:12,950
さくいんばこ？？？

99
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,110
I put in a wallet.

100
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,190
The wallet is already

101
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,270
this is Matsukata Hiroki's thing, huh?

102
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,510
It was already

103
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,720
No, no. no.

104
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,030
I won't, I won't open it, but

105
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,690
What is this...?

106
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,880
This is frightening.

107
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:24,790
I'm scared.

108
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,930
I'm scared to open it.

109
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,340
I won't open it!

110
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,250
I won't open it! But anyways,

111
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,710
It's kinda incredible.

112
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,490
No, no.

113
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,840
This is what they are,

114
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,180
these things called long wallets.

115
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,910
No, no, no.

116
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,470
And then,

117
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,750
tea, right?

118
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,930
Hey, come on...

119
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,560
Hey, this, well

120
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,310
Takahashi Mary June drinks the same thing.

121
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,020
??? Hey, don't make fun of "Azuki Beautiful Women Tea"!

122
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,830
How long do you think I've been drinking this?

123
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,160
The thing you drink

124
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,830
is the same thing models drink.

125
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,240
Oh.

126
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,020
Why do you always have these kinds of things in there?

127
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,990
Isn't it normal?

128
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,630
I'm getting a bit nervous.

129
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
The thing you rub your face with might appear.

130
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,930
It won't appear, it won't appear.

131
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,970
Anyways, the rest is, well

132
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,230
I put things in like sunglasses, and

133
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,140
I put in accessories I wear at places, right?

134
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,410
You're fast, huh?

135
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,350
This, everyone

136
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,630
I put in a little perfume.

137
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,190
Um, no.

138
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
In a bottle?

139
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,660
(?) Not separately?

140
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,240
With a bottle.

141
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,830
With a bottle??

142
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:19,890
With a bottle.

143
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,750
You bring it in a bottle?!

144
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,810
That's sure is amazing.

145
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,250
With a bottle.

146
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
That is amazing.

147
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,300
Because I have this, see?

148
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,050
It's secure.

149
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,190
This thing that closes like this.

150
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,440
Can this pass their airport?

151
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,350
Um,

152
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
There are times when I put it in a large one, but

153
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,520
(?) You can't tell regardless of whether it's big or small.

154
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,670
The rest is, well,

155
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,010
things like a charging adapter,

156
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,660
another one.

157
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,480
This, um, what's it called?

158
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:37,940
Ear phones.

159
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,330
Oh, this.

160
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:38,750
This!

161
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,340
This is extremely useful.

162
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,110
From one USB port,

163
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,740
USB-C, Lightning...

164
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,250
Um.

165
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,160
There's everything on this.

166
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,110
Because there are four prongs.

167
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,330
I have a small version of that.

168
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,970
(?) Is that so?

169
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,810
Today, this is what I intended to boast about the most,

170
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,400
so I brought it.

171
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,520
So with mine,

172
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,610
here, at the opening,

173
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,220
you can replace it with any of the three.

174
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,600
So with this,

175
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,140
with 4,

176
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,260
you can charge 4 at a time?

177
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,680
That's right.

178
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,150
That's why,

179
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,390
the speed is 1/4.

180
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,590
That's unacceptable.

181
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,040
But, it can do 4 at a time?

182
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,730
Yes, yes, yes.

183
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,850
So if I have a lot time to spare,

184
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,550
I use this.

185
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,700
When he has time to spare...

186
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,120
Ah! And this is,

187
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,779
a mobile air purifier.

188
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,910
It appeared...

189
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,560
Huh?

190
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,540
Why, everyone wears this.

191
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,040
This, Takahashi Mary June also has the same thing.

192
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,180
In principle, um,

193
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,850
in one minute,

194
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,980
the purified air is,

195
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,170
the air only around this is purified.

196
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,140
You know...

197
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,250
My surroundings are

198
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,050
Hey, stop that.

199
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
You're going to stop using that,

200
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,620
pretty soon.

201
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,380
Inside, there's a small purple light.

202
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,510
Everyone probably thinks this is a joke.

203
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,260
This is the reality.

204
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,330
This guy always has things like that in his bag.

205
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,070
The rest is,

206
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,950
now I'm doing things like writing some lyrics.

207
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,990
And books I want to read, right?

208
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,520
But they're in your computer.

209
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,100
No, no.

210
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,200
The thing about books is,

211
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,670
if it's not a book, I can't.

212
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,860
These kinds of books I really like.

213
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,830
(?) Things like "searching for words"

214
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,660
This is amazing.

215
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,640
This is a bit of that, right?

216
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,230
Kobuchi.

217
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,480
You just added these to look cool.

218
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,960
No, no, no!

219
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,620
I actually put these in.

220
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,570
You totally added these to your bag just for coolness, didn't you?

221
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,150
In your bag?

222
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,280
A little bit for coolness right?

223
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
A little...

224
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm writing a little lyrics,

225
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,610
I wanted to show these, right?

226
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,960
Because, this is almost

227
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,550
unused.

228
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,110
It feels like it was never opened, right?

229
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,830
Stop it.

230
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,920
Stop it.

231
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,350
Today is a YouTube recording,

232
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,340
so I brought them.

233
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,590
The next is, well,

234
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,570
headphones.

235
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,520
Yes, this is, you know,

236
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,120
Hey, you know,

237
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,110
You already have earphones,

238
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,350
why do you need headphones?

239
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,100
This is what Neumann released.

240
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,810
Oh, is it?

241
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,090
Neumann released this.

242
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,870
Wow.

243
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,950
This, recently I've been using this very much.

244
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,510
This.

245
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,590
(?) Super topic.

246
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,050
Right?

247
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,680
Well even afterwards,

248
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,340
it's like that.

249
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,170
Ah, the next is, well,

250
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,040
earphones, right?

251
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,520
How many earphones do you have?

252
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,130
You have 3 that seem the same though.

253
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,610
No.

254
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,270
A weird person who use these while on the move.

255
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,760
If on the move, I use these.

256
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,990
When do you use this?

257
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,360
This?

258
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,540
This is when I run, for example.

259
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,220
Ah,

260
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,130
there's already 3 in here.

261
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,040
One is enough,

262
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,490
 just one.

263
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,720
Well the rest is, already,

264
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,490
that right?

265
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,800
Cough drops I always suck on.

266
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,430
Chapstick, right?

267
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,380
And next,

268
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,290
throat spray.

269
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,520
Something like Cemedine.

270
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,180
This is for your nose.

271
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,480
For pollen, those things you wear on your nose.

272
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,920
???

273
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,350
A little supplements, for example.

274
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,890
That's that.

275
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,280
???

276
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,880
is the most

277
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,760
(?) the clatter of the main topic of today, right?

278
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,960
You didn't bring but,

279
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,010
(?) The clatter, this

280
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,250
about 4 times the amount here, right?

281
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,310
Already, about the amount of one person living alone.

282
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,010
Like the same.

283
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

284
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,450
Let's spread this all out.

285
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,420
Yes. Oh these? Everything.

286
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,200
Kobuchi's stuff.

287
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm so good at lining these up.

288
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,490
Like lining stuff up, or

289
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,640
when writing on the blackboard

290
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,800
you're really good at, but,

291
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,870
the inside of your bag is extremely messy.

292
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,490
Why? I wonder.

293
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
You ask, but,

294
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,170
how do I clean up the inside of my bag?

295
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,550
How?

296
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
This is a different skill, right?

297
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,400
How do I clean the inside of my bag?

298
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,550
Because, there are no divisions.

299
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,510
So, I'll say one thing.

300
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,400
You don't need all this.

301
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,650
No... I need it.

302
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,390
Computer, and,

303
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,250
this charger, and

304
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,190
wallet,

305
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:50,980
and then

306
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,770
you only need one, either earphones or headphones.

307
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,480
I don't like that...

308
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,850
You also don't need a camera anymore.

309
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,750
なんて???しいな

310
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,080
Not needed.

311
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,630
I need it, I need it.

312
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,340
I definitely need this.

313
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,190
Yes.

314
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,090
But this is actually,

315
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:00,850
my,

316
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,590
a bit.

317
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,640
But really,

318
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,240
 this is it.

319
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,790
Yes.

320
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,480
This was the inside of my bag.

321
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,290
Next time.

322
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,190
I always bring this around.

323
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,250
Actually,

324
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,200
this is the first time I-

325
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,050
(?)いごえる Boku-note

326
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,130
Inside Kobukuro Kuroda's bag.
