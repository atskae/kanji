1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,210
Ok.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,029
Today is

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,270
"The inside of Kobukuro's bags"

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,420
We've been getting more

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,300
used to this YouTube thing.

6
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,830
Right?

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,240
We got used to it right?

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,540
Right?

9
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,190
It's getting fun.

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,550
From now on, I'm using "YouTuber" as my occupation.

11
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,450
You're already doing that.

12
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,320
If you say that

13
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,410
then it's actually going to be written on Wikipedia.

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,940
As a YouTuber

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm already a YouTuber.

16
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,050
Well, at this time as we are doing it.

17
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,460
Right, right.

18
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,700
So, today

19
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,210
so the thing called "Inside the Bag"

20
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,030
is often shown on TV, right?

21
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,450
Right?

22
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,770
Who would have thought that the day we'd do such a thing would come?

23
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,520
Honestly though,

24
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,110
we did have this conversation about

25
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,770
please do "Inside the Bag"

26
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,820
a TV show offered us to do.

27
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,120
We kept saying "we don't have time".

28
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,800
Until now we said "no" about 100 times.

29
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,870
Why didn't we have time?

30
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,820
This conversation, this conversation. right?

31
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,240
The YouTube staff, you know

32
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,270
when they asked us "How about next time?"

33
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,110
The time we said "ok"

34
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,170
the staff was so surprised.

35
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,910
Even though before we refused that much.

36
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,500
Right.

37
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,010
Kuroda's bar for YouTube,

38
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,110
is very low.

39
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,650
They said "that's how serious he is about YouTube".

40
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,230
They said, this is ok.

41
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,520
Ok, then

42
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,190
Kobuchi

43
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,920
Shall we show my actual bag?

44
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,270
This is the bag I always carry.

45
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,770
The Kobuchi Bag.

46
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,850
Hey, Kuroda,

47
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,910
can you carry this with one hand for a sec?

48
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,300
With one hand.

49
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:06,730
With one hand.

50
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,350
Hold it quickly.

51
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,080
Hold it quickly.

52
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,380
Hey, it's going to break my back!

53
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,290
Well, I carry this everyday.

54
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,160
Kobuchi, you really are something.

55
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,440
There's a lot of stuff.

56
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,940
Ok, this is typical.

57
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,870
My laptop.

58
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Lyrics, memos, all my music.

59
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
We can't show his desktop computer, but

60
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,970
to the point where you don't know which one is which,

61
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,380
there's like 100 icons on there.

62
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,530
Yeah, a crazy amount.

63
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,380
It is messy.

64
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,550
Ah, well

65
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,430
Computer charger.

66
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,780
Charge.

67
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,480
This is,

68
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,840
You have this.

69
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,230
Yes, yes.

70
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,410
Well recently,

71
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,770
I have bought a camera.

72
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,580
What kind of camera?

73
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,000
This is amazing.

74
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,100
Um,

75
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,780
Even among compact digital cameras,

76
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,110
this Canon, G5X

77
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,150
So Kobuchi's, you see

78
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,550
that

79
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,250
Kobuchi's

80
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,710
This even comes with a tripod.

81
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,680
That's amazing.

82
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,360
It doesn't come with it.

83
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,980
I added it.

84
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,470
Oh you added it.

85
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:57,870
That's amazing.

86
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,860
I did this myself.

87
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,910
No matter what, you,

88
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,670
after a month, you'll stop using this thing.

89
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
You sure are annoying.

90
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,990
Anyways

91
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,310
Masks, right?

92
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,280
A mask case?

93
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,660
Yup.

94
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,280
I always put a mask case in here.

95
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:09,788
That and also

96
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,250
It's obvious, but

97
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,940
Coin case.

98
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,110
I put in a wallet.

99
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,190
The wallet is already

100
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,270
you're like Hiroki Matsukata, huh?

101
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,510
It was already

102
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,720
No, no. no.

103
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,030
I won't, I won't open it, but

104
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,690
What is this...?

105
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,880
This is frightening.

106
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:24,790
I'm scared.

107
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,930
I'm scared to open it.

108
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,340
I won't open it!

109
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,250
I won't open it! But anyways,

110
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,710
This is something.

111
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,490
No, no.

112
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,840
This is what they are,

113
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,180
these things called long wallets.

114
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,910
No, no, no.

115
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,470
And then,

116
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,750
tea, right?

117
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,930
Hey, come on...

118
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,560
Hey, this, well

119
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,310
Takahashi Mary June drinks the same thing.

120
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,020
Don't make fun of "Red Bean Beautiful Women Tea"!

121
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,830
How long do you think I've been drinking this?

122
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,160
The thing you drink

123
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,830
is the same thing models drink.

124
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,240
Oh.

125
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,020
Why do you always have these kinds of things in there?

126
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,990
Isn't it normal?

127
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,630
I'm getting a bit nervous.

128
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
The thing you rub your face with might appear.

129
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,930
It won't appear, it won't appear.

130
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,970
Anyways, the rest is, well

131
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,230
I put things in like sunglasses, and

132
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,140
I put in accessories I wear on stage, right?

133
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,410
You're fast, huh?

134
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,350
This, everyone

135
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,630
I put in a little cologne.

136
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,190
Um, no.

137
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
In a bottle?

138
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,660
(?) Not separately?

139
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,240
With a bottle.

140
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,830
With a bottle??

141
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:19,890
With a bottle.

142
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,750
You bring it in a bottle?!

143
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,810
That's sure is amazing.

144
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,250
With a bottle.

145
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
That's crazy.

146
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,300
Because I have this, see?

147
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,050
It's secure.

148
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,190
This thing that closes like this.

149
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,440
Can you bring this on an airplane?

150
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,350
Um,

151
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
There are times when I put it into a large bag, but

152
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,520
(?) You can't tell regardless of whether it's big or small.

153
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,670
The rest is, well,

154
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,010
things like a charging adapter,

155
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,660
another one.

156
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,480
This, um, what's it called?

157
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:37,940
Ear phones.

158
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,330
Oh, this.

159
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:38,750
This!

160
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,340
This is extremely useful.

161
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,110
From one USB port,

162
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,740
USB-C, Lightning...

163
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,250
Um.

164
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,160
There's everything on this.

165
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,110
Because there are four prongs.

166
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,330
I have a small version of that.

167
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,970
Oh you do?

168
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,810
This is what I intended to brag about today the most,

169
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,400
so I brought it.

170
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,520
So with mine,

171
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,610
here, at the opening,

172
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,670
you can replace it with any of the three.

173
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,600
So with this,

174
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,140
with 4,

175
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,260
you can charge 4 at a time?

176
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,680
That's right.

177
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,150
That's why,

178
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,390
the speed is 4 times slower.

179
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,590
That's unacceptable.

180
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,040
But, it can do 4 at a time?

181
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,730
Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,850
So if I have a lot time to spare,

183
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,550
I use this.

184
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,700
When he has time to spare...

185
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,120
Ah! And this is,

186
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,779
a mobile air purifier.

187
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,910
It appeared...

188
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,560
Huh?

189
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,540
Why, everyone wears this.

190
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,040
This, Takahashi Mary June also has the same thing.

191
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,180
In principle, um,

192
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,850
in one minute,

193
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,980
the purified air is,

194
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,170
the air only around this is purified.

195
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,140
You know...

196
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,250
My surroundings are

197
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,050
Hey, stop that.

198
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
You're going to stop using that,

199
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,620
pretty soon.

200
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,380
Inside, there's a small purple light.

201
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,510
Everyone probably thinks this is a joke.

202
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,260
But this is actually true.

203
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,330
This guy always has things like that in his bag.

204
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,070
The rest is,

205
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,950
now I'm doing things like writing some lyrics.

206
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,990
And books I want to read, right?

207
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,520
But they're in your computer.

208
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,100
No, no.

209
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,200
The thing about books is,

210
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,670
if it's not a book, I can't.

211
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,860
These kinds of books I really like.

212
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,830
(?) Things like "searching for words"

213
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,660
This is amazing.

214
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,640
This is a bit of that, right?

215
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,230
Kobuchi.

216
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,480
You just added these to look cool.

217
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,960
No, no, no!

218
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,620
I actually put these in.

219
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,570
You totally added these to your bag just for coolness, didn't you?

220
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,150
In your bag?

221
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,280
A little bit for coolness right?

222
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
A little...

223
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm writing a little lyrics,

224
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,610
I wanted to show these, right?

225
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,960
Because, this is almost

226
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,550
unused.

227
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,110
It feels like it was never opened, right?

228
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,830
Stop it.

229
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,920
Stop it.

230
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,350
Today is a YouTube recording,

231
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,340
so I brought them.

232
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,590
The next is, well,

233
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,570
headphones.

234
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,520
Yes, this is, you know,

235
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,120
Hey, you know,

236
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,110
You already have earphones,

237
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,350
why do you need headphones?

238
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,100
This is what Neumann released.

239
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,810
Oh, is it?

240
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,090
Neumann released this.

241
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,870
Wow.

242
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,950
This, recently I've been using this very much.

243
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,510
This.

244
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,590
(?) Super topic.

245
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,050
Right?

246
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,680
Well even afterwards,

247
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,340
it's like that.

248
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,170
Ah, the next is, well,

249
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,040
earphones, right?

250
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,520
How many earphones do you have?

251
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,130
You have 3 that seem the same though.

252
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,610
No.

253
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,270
A weird person who use these while on the move.

254
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,760
If on the move, I use these.

255
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,990
When do you use this?

256
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,360
This?

257
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,540
This is when I run, for example.

258
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,220
Ah,

259
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,130
there's already 3 in here.

260
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,040
One is enough,

261
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,490
 just one.

262
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,720
Well the rest is, already,

263
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,490
that right?

264
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,800
Cough drops I always suck on.

265
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,430
Chapstick, right?

266
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,380
And next,

267
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,290
throat spray.

268
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,520
Something like Cemedine.

269
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,180
This is for your nose.

270
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,480
For pollen, those things you wear on your nose.

271
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,920
???

272
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,350
A little supplements, for example.

273
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,890
That's that.

274
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,280
???

275
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,880
is the most

276
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,760
(?) the clatter of the main topic of today, right?

277
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,960
You didn't bring but,

278
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,010
(?) The clatter, this

279
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,250
about 4 times the amount here, right?

280
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,310
Already, about the amount of one person living alone.

281
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,010
Like the same.

282
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

283
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,450
Let's spread this all out.

284
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,420
Yes. Oh these? Everything.

285
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,200
Kobuchi's stuff.

286
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm so good at lining these up.

287
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,490
Like lining stuff up, or

288
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,640
when writing on the blackboard

289
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,800
you're really good at, but,

290
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,870
the inside of your bag is extremely messy.

291
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,490
Why? I wonder.

292
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
You ask, but,

293
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,170
how do I clean up the inside of my bag?

294
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,550
How?

295
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
I guess this is a different skill.

296
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,400
How do I clean the inside of my bag?

297
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,550
Because, there are no divisions.

298
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,510
So, I'll say one thing.

299
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,400
You don't need all this.

300
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,650
No... I need it.

301
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,390
Computer, and,

302
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,250
this charger, and

303
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,190
wallet,

304
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:50,980
and then

305
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,770
you only need one, either earphones or headphones.

306
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,480
I don't like that...

307
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,850
You also don't need a camera anymore.

308
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,750
なんて???しいな

309
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,080
Not needed.

310
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,630
I need it, I need it.

311
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,340
I definitely need this.

312
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,190
Yes.

313
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,090
But this is actually,

314
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:00,850
my,

315
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,590
a bit.

316
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,640
But really,

317
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,240
 this is it.

318
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,790
Yes.

319
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,480
This was the inside of my bag.

320
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,290
Next time.

321
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,190
I always bring this around.

322
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,250
Actually,

323
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,200
this is the first time I-

324
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,050
(?)いごえる Boku-note

325
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,130
Inside Kobukuro Kuroda's bag.
