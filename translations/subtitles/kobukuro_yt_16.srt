1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,220
Yes.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,180
Today is

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,270
The inside of Kobukuro's bag.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,420
We've gotten more

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,510
used to this YouTube thing.

6
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,140
Right?

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,240
We got used to it right?

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,540
Right?

9
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,190
It became fun.

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,820
From now on, I'm putting in the "occupation" field

11
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,450
You're already putting it in.

12
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,320
When you say that

13
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,420
then it's actually going to be written on Wikipedia.

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,940
As a YouTuber

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm already a YouTuber.

16
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,050
Well, at this time as we are doing it.

17
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,460
Right, right.

18
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,700
So, today

19
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,220
so the thing called "Inside the Bag"

20
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
is often shown on TV.

21
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,850
Right?

22
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Who would have thought that the day we'd do such a thing would come?

23
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,640
Honestly though
