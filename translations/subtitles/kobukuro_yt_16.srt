1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,220
Yes.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,180
Today is

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,270
The inside of Kobukuro's bag.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,420
We've gotten more

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,510
used to this YouTube thing.

6
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,140
Right?

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,240
We got used to it right?

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,540
Right?

9
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,190
It became fun.

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,820
From now on, I'm putting in the "occupation" field

11
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,450
You're already putting it in.

12
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,320
When you say that

13
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,420
then it's actually going to be written on Wikipedia.

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,940
As a YouTuber

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm already a YouTuber.

16
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,050
Well, at this time as we are doing it.

17
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,460
Right, right.

18
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,700
So, today

19
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,220
so the thing called "Inside the Bag"

20
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
is often shown on TV, right?

21
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,850
Right?

22
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Who would have thought that the day we'd do such a thing would come?

23
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,640
Honestly though,

24
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,120
we did have this conversation about

25
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,770
please do "Inside the Bag"

26
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,820
a TV show offered us to do.

27
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,120
(?) Since we didn't have spare time, we said no.

28
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,800
Until now we said "no" about 100 times.

29
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,870
(?) Why because of spare time?

30
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,820
This story, this story. right?

31
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,240
People that think of YouTube, you know

32
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,510
when they asked us "How about next time?"

33
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,230
The time we said "ok"

34
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,180
the staff was so surprised.

35
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,100
Even though before we refused that much.

36
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,410
Right.

37
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,170
Kuroda's bar for YouTube,

38
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,220
is very low.

39
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,650
That's how serious I am about YouTube.

40
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,230
This is ok.

41
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,520
Ok, then
