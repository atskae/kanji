1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,220
Yes.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,180
Today is

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,270
The inside of Kobukuro's bag.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,420
We've gotten more

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,510
used to this YouTube thing.

6
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,140
Right?

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,240
We got used to it right?

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,540
Right?

9
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,190
It became fun.

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,820
From now on, I'm putting in the "occupation" field

11
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,450
You're already putting it in.

12
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,320
When you say that

13
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,420
then it's actually going to be written on Wikipedia.

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,940
As a YouTuber

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm already a YouTuber.

16
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,050
Well, at this time as we are doing it.

17
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,460
Right, right.

18
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,700
So, today

19
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,220
so the thing called "Inside the Bag"

20
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
is often shown on TV, right?

21
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,850
Right?

22
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Who would have thought that the day we'd do such a thing would come?

23
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,640
Honestly though,

24
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,120
we did have this conversation about

25
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,770
please do "Inside the Bag"

26
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,820
a TV show offered us to do.

27
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,120
(?) Since we didn't have spare time, we said no.

28
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,800
Until now we said "no" about 100 times.

29
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,870
(?) Why because of spare time?

30
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,820
This story, this story. right?

31
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,240
People that think of YouTube, you know

32
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,510
when they asked us "How about next time?"

33
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,230
The time we said "ok"

34
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,180
the staff was so surprised.

35
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,100
Even though before we refused that much.

36
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,410
Right.

37
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,170
Kuroda's bar for YouTube,

38
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,220
is very low.

39
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,650
That's how serious I am about YouTube.

40
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,230
This is ok.

41
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,520
Ok, then

42
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,240
Kobuchi

43
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,130
Is it ok to show something realistic?

44
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,390
This is the bag I always carry.

45
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:02,960
Kobuchi bag.

46
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,000
Hey, Kuroda,

47
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,910
can you quickly carry this with one hand?

48
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,300
With one hand.

49
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:06,730
With one hand.

50
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,350
Hold it quickly.

51
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,080
Hold it quickly.

52
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,390
Hey, my back is going to get messed up.

53
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,630
Well, I use this everyday.

54
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,780
Kobuchi is actually

55
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,200
as is, right?

56
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,440
I have a lot of baggage.

57
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,940
Ok, this is usual.

58
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,870
My computer.

59
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Lyrics, memos, everything, songs,

60
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
We can't show the desktop computer, but

61
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,970
to the point where you don't know which one is which,

62
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,380
there's like 100 icons on there.

63
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,680
Right, there's an enormous amount.

64
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,390
It is messy.

65
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,550
Ah, well

66
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,430
Computer charger.

67
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,780
Charge.

68
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,480
This is,

69
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,840
You have this.

70
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,230
Yes, yes.

71
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,620
Well recently,

72
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,780
I have bought a camera.

73
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,580
What kind of camera did you buy?

74
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,000
This is very good.

75
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,100
Um,

76
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,780
Even in this compact digital camera,

77
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,110
this Canon, G5X

78
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,150
So Kobuchi's, you see

79
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,550
that

80
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,250
Kobuchi's

81
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,710
This even comes with a tripod.

82
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,680
That's amazing.

83
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,360
It doesn't come with it.

84
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,980
I added it.

85
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,470
Oh you added it.

86
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:57,870
That's amazing.

87
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,860
(?) I devised this.

88
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,910
No matter what, you,

89
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,670
after a month, you'll stop using this thing.

90
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
You sure are annoying.

91
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,990
Anyways

92
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,310
Masks, right?

93
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,280
A mask case?

94
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,660
Yup.

95
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,280
I always put a mask case in here.

96
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:09,789
That and also

97
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,550
It's obvious, but

98
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:12,950
さくいんばこ？？？

99
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,110
I put in a wallet.

100
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,190
The wallet is already

101
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,270
this is Matsukata Hiroki's thing, huh?

102
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,510
It was already

103
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,720
No, no. no.

104
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,030
I won't, I won't open it, but

105
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,690
What is this...?

106
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,880
This is frightening.

107
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:24,790
I'm scared.

108
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,930
I'm scared to open it.

109
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,340
I won't open it!

110
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,250
I won't open it! But anyways,

111
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,710
It's kinda incredible.

112
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,490
No, no.

113
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,620
This is what

114
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,370
long wallets are.

115
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,940
No, no, no.
